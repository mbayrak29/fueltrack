FuelTrack 🚗⛽⚡

Unified Fuel & EV Price Tracking and Route Cost Planner

FuelTrack is a fully functional web application developed as a Final Term MVP Project for
CITF1003 – Introduction to Information Technologies and Applications.

The application helps users track fuel and EV charging prices, compare costs by fuel type, and estimate intercity route expenses using real user inputs.
